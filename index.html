            <p>I’ve found that pretty much as soon as I start the timer my focus goes up. It’s almost like a race to see
                how
                quickly I can get that task finished. And, because I don’t want the timer to be inaccurate I tend to
                stay on
                task.

                Keeping track of time also lets me look back on my day and see how much time I actually spent doing
                something
                productive.
